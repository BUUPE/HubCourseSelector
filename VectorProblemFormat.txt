1 line: A, the number of lines of metadata. 0 <= A
A lines: Metadata of the problem. Not the actual problem input itself. For example, course information, time created, etc.
1 line: M, the length of vectors. 1 <= M
1 line: N, the number of vectors. 1 <= N
1 line:
	The graduation requirement vector. Also known as credit_maxes vector.
	The line contains M integers which are the integers of the vector.
	Integers are separated by one or more spaces.
	The line may have leading spaces and trailing spaces.
	Integers are represented using only digits.
N lines:
	Each line contains one integer for the vector id followed by M integers which are the integers of the vector.
	The vector ids start at 0 and increase by 1.
	Integers on a line are separated by one or more spaces.
	Lines may have leading spaces and trailing spaces.
	Integers are represented using only digits.

A line not followed by a line does not need to end with a new line character.
Under this format, a problem is described entirely by one file.

The N vectors are called the course vectors.

This describes the input. It is up to other programs to compute what they wish from the input.
For example, they may wish to compute a minimal subset of vectors such that each component of the vector sum is no less than the corresponding component of the credit_maxes vector.

Programs can extract the course vectors and credit_maxes vector by using the read_problem function from download_problems.py.
